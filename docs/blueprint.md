# **App Name**: NutriSnap

## Core Features:

- Image Upload/Capture: Allow users to upload an image of a food product or take a picture using their device's camera.
- Food Identification: Utilize an AI model to identify the food product in the image. This model will be used as a tool to identify food items from an image.
- Nutritional Data Retrieval: Fetch nutritional information for the identified food product from a public API (e.g., Nutritionix).
- Nutritional Information Display: Display the nutritional information (calories, macros, etc.) to the user.
- Calorie Tracking: Allow users to create a simple daily meal plan and track calorie intake based on identified food products. Diet plan can be stored in local storage.
- Weight Loss Plan Tracking: Allow users to input their target calorie intake and track their progress daily and weekly. Provide visual analysis of calorie consumption.
- Weight Input and Profile Storage: Enable users to enter and store their weight in their profile to track weight loss progress.
- Water Intake Tracking: Track the user's water intake. Allow users to log their daily water consumption and set reminders.
- Exercise Logging: Allow users to manually log their exercise activities (e.g., running, swimming) and estimate calorie burn.
- Macro Tracking: Track the user's macro-nutrient ratio (protein, carbs, fat) intake to ensure they meet their dietary goals.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Fresh green (#4CAF50) to represent health and food.
- Secondary color: Light grey (#F0F0F0) for backgrounds and neutral elements.
- Accent color: Orange (#FF9800) for interactive elements and call-to-action buttons.
- Clean and simple layout with clear sections for image input, food identification results, and nutritional information.
- Use recognizable icons for food categories (e.g., fruit, vegetable, meat) and nutritional information (e.g., calories, protein, carbs).
- Subtle animations for loading states and transitions between different sections.

## Original User Request:

Build a app that can identify food products from an uploaded picture or
in-browser camera. The app should be able to find out the nuritional value of that meal and add that to the meal consumption plan - it should also be able to track it against the diet plan - calorie count etc
